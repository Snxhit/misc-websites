# My First Blog Post
Published on: 2025-2-2

Welcome to my _first ever blog_, about me learning Astro! Here, I will be sharing with you, my accomplishments and goals!

## What I've accomplished so far:

1. **Installing Astro**: I created a new Astro project and set it up.
2. **Making the Pages**: I then learned how to make subpages, by using `.astro` files!
3. **Making Blog Posts**: Right now, I'm writing this blog post for my blog page, and I'm starting to get a hang of it!

## What's Next?
I shall finish the Astro tutorial and then ascend to the heavens.
